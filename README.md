## Classification

Open the Colab Notebook: Open the provided Google Colab notebook link.

Dataset Upload:
Download the "Face Mask Detection" dataset from Kaggle.

Upload the data folder containing the with_mask and without_mask subdirectories to the Colab environment. You can do this by dragging and dropping the folder into the file explorer on the left side of the Colab interface. Or just running the first line of the code.

Run the Cells:
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially by clicking the play button or pressing Shift + Enter.
The code will load the data, extract features, train the models, and display the results.

View Results:
The accuracy of each model will be printed in the output of the corresponding cells.

Insert Images:
To effectively display the results, insert images of the following into the report where indicated.
Example images from the dataset: Insert a few example images from the "with_mask" and "without_mask" folders to illustrate the dataset. (Insert these images after the dataset section)
Graph comparing the accuracy of the SVM and Neural Network: Insert a bar graph showing the accuracy of each model. You can generate this graph using matplotlib or another plotting library within the Colab notebook and then download the image. (Insert this image into the results section)

## Classification
Open the colab notebook 
Run all the cells sequentially
